base using:
valgrind <valid command>

leak details:
valgrind --leak-check=full <valid command>

how to read results of valgrind's output:
bad cases are next =
	definitely lost bytes
	possible lost bytes
some specific:
	valgrind on mac shows lost bytes 72 bytes in 3 blocks. this is unideal graphic library on MAC.

in a case, when you malloc some memory and do not initialized it,
valgrind will show an indirectly reading-writing warning.
for fixing it you need to use ft_memcalloc function.
it initialize memory as nulls. it mean:
all pointers inside structure will be NULL,
all chars will '\0',
all integers will be 0.

also, when call malloc, better to get a structure, not a pointer.
also, when call malloc for structure and it consis of some different types of elements,
OS give back the same blocks of memory for every structure element.
